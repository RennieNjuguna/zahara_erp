# Payment System Changes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to implement the new payment system requirements for customer order status tracking and enhanced customer balance reporting.

## Changes Made

### 1. Order Status System

#### Updated Order Model (`backend/orders/models.py`)
- **New Status Choices**: Updated the `STATUS_CHOICES` to include:
  - `'pending'` - Default status for new orders
  - `'paid'` - Status after payment allocation
  - `'claim'` - Status for bad produce (with credit note)
  - `'cancelled'` - Status for cancelled orders

- **Default Status**: Changed default status from `'original'` to `'pending'`

- **New Methods Added**:
  - `is_paid()`: Checks if order is fully paid based on payment allocations and credit notes
  - `mark_as_claim(reason)`: Marks order as claim and automatically creates credit note
  - `cancel_order(reason)`: Cancels an order and updates status

- **Automatic Status Updates**: Orders automatically change from `'pending'` to `'paid'` when fully paid

### 2. Customer Statistics Enhancement

#### Updated Customer Model (`backend/customers/models.py`)
- **New Method**: `get_order_statistics()` returns comprehensive order statistics:
  - Total number of orders
  - Total sales amount
  - Pending orders count
  - Paid orders count
  - Claimed orders count
  - Cancelled orders count

### 3. Enhanced Customer Balance View

#### Updated Customer Balance List View (`backend/payments/views.py`)
- **Enhanced Statistics**: Now shows:
  - Customer name
  - Total number of orders
  - Total sales amount
  - Currency
  - Claimed orders count
  - Outstanding orders count (pending orders)
  - Current balance

- **Improved Performance**: Uses customer statistics method for efficient data retrieval

### 4. Updated Customer Balance Template

#### Updated Template (`backend/payments/templates/payments/customer_balance_list.html`)
- **New Table Structure**:
  ```
  Customer | Total Number of Orders | Total Sales | Currency | Claimed Orders | Outstanding Orders | Balance | Actions
  ```

- **Removed Columns**:
  - Total Outstanding (replaced by Balance)
  - Last Updated (not needed in new structure)

### 5. Payment Allocation Integration

#### Updated Payment Models (`backend/payments/models.py`)
- **Automatic Order Status Updates**: Added signal to automatically update order status to `'paid'` when payment allocations are created/updated
- **Enhanced Balance Recalculation**: Improved customer balance calculation to include new order statuses

### 6. Database Migration

#### Created Migration (`backend/orders/migrations/0009_alter_order_status.py`)
- Updates existing orders to use new status choices
- Sets default status to `'pending'`

### 7. Management Commands

#### Created Command (`backend/orders/management/commands/update_order_statuses.py`)
- Updates existing orders to have correct status based on payment allocations
- Can be run with: `python manage.py update_order_statuses`

## Key Features

### 1. Order Status Workflow
1. **Order Created**: Status = `'pending'`
2. **Payment Allocated**: Status automatically changes to `'paid'` when fully paid
3. **Bad Produce**: Use `mark_as_claim()` to change status to `'claim'` and create credit note
4. **Cancellation**: Use `cancel_order()` to change status to `'cancelled'`

### 2. Credit Note Integration
- Claimed orders automatically create credit notes
- Credit notes are linked to order items
- Credit amounts are calculated based on stems affected

### 3. Enhanced Reporting
- Customer balance table now shows comprehensive statistics
- Easy to see total orders, sales, and outstanding amounts
- Clear separation between claimed and outstanding orders

## Testing

The system has been tested with:
- Order creation with pending status
- Payment allocation and automatic status change to paid
- Customer statistics calculation
- Balance recalculation

## Usage Examples

### Marking an Order as Claim
```python
order = Order.objects.get(invoice_code='TEST001')
credit_note = order.mark_as_claim("Bad produce - flowers wilted")
```

### Cancelling an Order
```python
order = Order.objects.get(invoice_code='TEST001')
order.cancel_order("Customer cancelled order")
```

### Getting Customer Statistics
```python
customer = Customer.objects.get(name='Test Customer')
stats = customer.get_order_statistics()
print(f"Total orders: {stats['total_orders']}")
print(f"Total sales: {stats['total_sales']}")
print(f"Pending orders: {stats['pending_orders']}")
```

## Files Modified
1. `backend/orders/models.py` - Order status system and methods
