## Logic Applied

### **Status Determination Rules**:
1. **'claim'**: Orders with existing credit notes (indicating bad produce or returns)
2. **'paid'**: Orders that are fully paid based on payment allocations and credit notes
3. **'pending'**: Orders that are not fully paid and have no claims

### **Payment Detection**:
- Used the `order.is_paid()` method to determine if orders are fully paid
- This method considers:
  - Total payment allocations to the order
  - Total credit notes for the order
  - Order total amount

### **Claim Detection**:
- Checked for existing `CreditNote` objects linked to each order
- Orders with credit notes are automatically marked as 'claim'

## Commands Used

### **2. Simple Default Status Update**
